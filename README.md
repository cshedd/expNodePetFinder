#ADOPTABLES
##This app is currently under construction as we move from MySQL/Sequelize to MongoDB/Mongoose, implement social media sign in via passport, and scrape the shelter webpages for info instead of using the Petfinder API. 

Adoptables is an app that gives the user a more accessable and engaging way to browse for their next fluffy life parter. Have you ever gone to an animal shelter and almost walked out with 10 new pets becuase you couldn't stand leaving them there? Us too. Thats where Adoptables comes in, browse for your new companion without having to stroll past pets that whine for you as you walk by. 

This dynamic web app was created with Node.js, Express, Petfinder API, Gulp, ejs, MySQL, Sequelize, jQuery, and Passport.
